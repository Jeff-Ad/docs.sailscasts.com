# Redis

## Install adapter

To setup Sails Stash to use Redis as the cache store, install the [sails-redis](https://github.com/balderdash/sails-redis) Waterline adapter:

```sh
npm i sails-redis
```

## Setup datastore

Next, setup the datastore for your cache in `config/datastores.js`:

```js
module.exports.datastores = {
  default: {}
  cache: {
    adapter: 'sails-redis',
    url: 'redis://localhost:6379'
  }
}
```

That's it, your Sails app is now ready to use Redis for caching ðŸ¥³.

::: tip
In production, do make sure to replace the `url` to Redis with an environment variable like `process.env.REDIS_CACHE_URL`
